# Source code of paper: Hyperspherical Clustering and Sampling for Rare Event Analysis with Multiple Failure Region Coverage
## algorithms
the package implements algorithms outlines in ["Hyperspherical Clustering and Sampling for Rare Event Analysis with Multiple Failure Region Coverage"](http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/pub/C164.pdf)
1. Importance Sampling
Different from traditional monte carlo, IS constructs a new “proposed” sampling distribution under which a rare event becomes less rare so more failures can be captured.
2. Hyperspherical K-means.
A way to partition failure areas from aspect of angles.
